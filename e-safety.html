    <h2>Phishing</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Phishing is a fraudulent operation involving the use of emails.</li>
        <li>The creator sends out a legitimate looking email hoping to gather personal and financial information from the recipient of the email.</li>
        <li>The message appears to be from a legitimate source (e.g. a famous bank)</li>
        <li>When the user clicks on the link, they are sent to a spoof website</li>
        <li>They will be asked for personal info e.g. credit card details, PINs</li>
        <li>This could lead to identity theft.</li>
        <li>Phishing emails can be filtered using ISPs.</li>

    </ul>
    
     
    
    <h2>Pharming</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Pharming is a scam in which malicious code is installed on a computer hard disk or a server</li>
        <li>This code can misdirect users to fraudulent websites without their knowledge</li>
        <li>Phishing requires an email to be sent to every person who has been targeted, while pharming does not require emails to be sent out to anyone</li>
        <li>Pharming can target a larger group of people more easily</li>
    <h3>How pharming works:</h3>
        <li>A hacker will infect the computer with a virus, either by sending an email or installing software on their computer when they first visit their website</li>
        <li>Once infected, the virus sends user to a fake website that looks identical to the one they wanted to visit</li>
        <li>Personal info from the user’s computer can be picked up by the pharmer/hacker</li>
        <li>Anti-spyware, anti-virus software or anti-pharming software can be used to identify this code and correct the corruption</li>
    </ul>
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
     
    
    <h2>Smishing</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>An attempt to extract a user’s confidential information via SMS (short message service) by tricking the user into downloading a Trojan horse (a virus that masks itself).</li>
            <li>It is phishing via SMS.</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>How to prevent phishing, pharming & smishing</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>User education</li>
        <li>Set up anti-malware and anti-spyware software</li>
        <li>Enabling protocols such as SPF and DKIM</li>
        <li>Do not download random .exe (executable file formats), .php, .bat, .com etc.</li>
        <li>If a person on the internet is asking for personal information, or to meet in real life or acting suspicious, they should be reported to cyber security agencies, or one’s parents/guardians.</li>
        <li>Websites/pop-ups can be made to mimic legitimate ones, or seem too good to be true, for e.g.lotrei.net instead of lottery.com</li>
    </ul>
