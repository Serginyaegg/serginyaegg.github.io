      <h2>Different types of working patterns</h2>

        <ul>

        <li><strong>Part-time working:</strong> A contract where someone works fewer hours per week than a full-time employee, in shifts.</li><br>
        
        <li><strong>Flexible working (flexi-time):</strong> Workers can choose their working time but will have to complete the day's work.</li><br>
        
        <li><strong>Job sharing:</strong> Two or more part-time workers divide their job, replacing one full-time worker.</li><br>
        
        <li><strong>Compressed hours:</strong> Employees can work longer hours per day but over fewer days, completing the workload sooner.</li><br>
